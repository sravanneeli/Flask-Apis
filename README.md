# Flask-Api's
In this repository I am developing different flask api's which are basic and useful.
All this API's work with postman calling with proper url mentioned for each api
Clone the repository and run the `apis.py` script which will run in local server. Call the required api for after the local server url address.

## IMDB Data Search (`/imdb`) 
While using this api the url address then `/imdb` should be used.
  1. In this api given a question about actor acted in which movies the response will be recent five(5) movies of the actor.
  2. Given a question about which movies are directed by a particular director it returns recent five(5) movies directed by that director.
